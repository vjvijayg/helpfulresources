Usefull notes for the Magento 2

1. Disable Magento cache

Disabling Magento cache during development will save you some time because you won’t need to manually flush the cache every time you make changes to your code.

The easiest way to disable cache is to go to Admin → System → Cache Management → select all cache types and disable them.

2. Put Magento into a developer mode

You should put Magento into a developer mode to ensure that you see all the errors Magento is throwing at you.

In order to do this, open your terminal and go to the Magento 2 root. From there you should run the following command:

php bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer
